# GGF
Intended to enumerate ports, GGF was create aiming to do that with the highest speed possible. Just a lame excuse to practice some scripting skills. 
I might implement the ```gethostbyname``` function in the future. I don't know, nmap can't really be replaced. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I did use ```multiprocessing``` to speed up the process.
